# allAboutArray

This project will walk you through all possible array's methods in visual form 
Here you can see how will use filter(), includes(),sort(), shift(), unshift() and many more.

As we will grow will try to refactor code to enhance code readability and reuseability and most important performance improvment.
I will try to include all concepts which I have learnt or going to learn.
